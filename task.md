## Status
- [x] Install `country-flag-icons` or use SVG assets for high-quality flags (using emojis as fallback if needed, but aiming for premium look). <!-- id: 0 -->
- [x] Refactor `LanguageSelector` to match the provided screenshot:
    - [x] White background trigger button with shadow and border.
    - [x] Dropdown with grid layout (or clean list) and flags.
    - [x] Premium typography and spacing. <!-- id: 1 -->
- [x] Ensure it works within the Navbar but stands out as a distinct element. <!-- id: 2 -->
- [x] Revert to Material UI functionality for the popover behavior. <!-- id: 3 -->
